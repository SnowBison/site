# The iPod Mini

The short-lived but much beloved iPod mini was launched in 2004. 
This was a time when mobile computing was still developing, laptops were just becoming mainstream, breaking out of wall street, and boy bands roamed the earth unchallenged.
The iPod had gone through four(ish) hardware generations at this point, the iMac was starting to fill up school computer labs, and Apple was finally recovering from its inter-Steve period.

## The Dial

The first generation iPod came with a dial controller, which at the time was revolutionary. Traditional cassette-style controls were provided using hardware buttons that radiated out from the dial.
The genius of the dial controller is really a triumph of hardware and software. The original iPod OS is essentially just a system of menus for browsing an internal database, and if all a user needs to do is browse through a database, a scroll wheel with a select button is sufficient. There's an additional detail, oft forgotten but extremely important: iPod OS uses a selective inertia system to enhance the dial interface. 
In other words, scrolling for a while and at high speed instructs the browser to skip lines, speeding up the database search process.

For contrast, consider the Fiio X3. Fiio as a brand is exemplified by outstanding hardware and sub-par software[^1]. The X3 was released in <!--TODO: Check this date, I wanna say 2013 because I think I was in high school--> and has a physical dial like first and second generation iPods. 
It did not implement this inertia system, and it's considerably harder to use as a result. 
Luckily touch screens got really cheap in the intervening time, so they didn't really have to learn this lesson, and the dial became a relict of the halcyon pre-capacitive-touch era.

## The Touch Wheel

The dial had some problems. 
The main one is that little specks of dirt, grime, and human oil would slip in through the tolerance cracks and gum up the dial's sensors and gears.
Capacitive touch was just barely out of reach at scale, the USB 2.0 standard meant that USB would win out over Apple's own FireWire standard, and the first and second generation iPods were starting to show their age.
This led to Apple's first true hardware revision of the iPod: the very cool, very expensive, and very weird third generation iPod.
In order to improve longevity, Apple replaced the dial with the "Touch Wheel", one of the first capacitive interfaces in a commercial product. The cassette-style controls were moved to four touch-sensitive, glowing red buttons above the touch wheel and below the screen.

## The Click Wheel

The click wheel is probably the thing the iPod is best known for. By combining the capacitive surface with traditional buttons, the iPod was left with a slick interface, with minimal clutter, and was easy to use and understand.


## The Microdrive

We've now progressed into the third millennium and storage space started getting cheaper and smaller. Flash storage became available to consumers. Although Apple only ever shipped the Nano line with flash storage, the iPod mini still owes it's innovations to this jump forward in flash technology.
