## My work was recently featured in WIRED thanks to a discovery about art by my former colleagues Trent Davis and Wilma Bainbridge! Check it out [here!](https://www.wired.com/story/beauty-is-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder-but-memorability-may-be-universal/)

I am a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at the Computational Social Science Lab at University of Pennsylvania. I previously worked at Microsoft Research, NYC in the Computational Social Science group. I have a Masters of Computational Social Science from the University of Chicago with my thesis research on using deep learning to estimate the memorability of images. As an undergraduate at Washington University in St. Louis, I majored in Physics and Economics, and minored in the Philosophy of Science. My work focuses on developing novel methods for social scientific concepts. My hobbies include analyzing video games, cooking, and playing classical guitar. 

This site is intended to be a place for me to post my projects, some personal, some academic. They are mostly computational in nature, but some are philosophical.
